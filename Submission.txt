Coding Asssigment has been completed,

I have created a backend web server using nodejs(Javascript) that exposes a single endpoint. This endpoint accepts a bot identifier, a visitor written message and confidence threshold. It returns a single reply corresponding to the highest predicted intent above the confidence threshold.I have used the publicly available AI API in order to retrieve the list of predicted intents for a given message.

The api-server and mongodb are containerised using docker. Please Make sure you have all required software installed mentioned in Software Prerequisites.

I also have attached a README.md file in code repository which explains step by step guide to run the application.

Guides:

1. Software Prerequisites 
2. Code Setup
3. How to Start the api-server 
4. How to Stop the api-server
5. How to Run the tests 
6. How to Access the chat reply api once api-server is up. 


Please let me know if you faces any issues
